<h1>Standard Atmosphere calculator</h1>

If you give this program altitude in meters it will show you all the steps for calculating the pressure at that altitude, so you can double check your answers.

The altitude is geopotential altitude in meters, so it was assumed that g stays constant as the altitude increases, the difference between using geopotential and geometric is almost negligible. Air moisture levels have also not been taken into account, but this difference is even more negligible.
